Workspaces for Editorial Teams
==============================

A major focus for Neos 2.1 have been "nested workspaces". Workspaces allow editors to collect and review content before publishing
it to the live website. Now, with nested workspaces, it is possible to stack one workspace on another and prepare larger content
changes in a team. Previously it was only possible for editors to make changes in their personal workspace which would only
become visible to other editors once published to the live website.

This new feature allows editors to jointly work on content for multiple content in parallel, and let all content be reviewed by
our editors in charge before they are published to the live website.

Side-by-side comparison of changes in Workspace Management
==========================================================
This change adds a side-by-side view of changes of a given workspace to the "Review" view of the Workspace Management module.
It highlights inline text changes and displays thumbnails of changed assets.

This new feature relies on a third party diff library which has been modernized and comes packaged with the Neos distribution
from now on. Further details are available on Github.
