`BUGFIX: Use correct relative paths in built CSS files <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/524>`_

The built CSS file concatenated library CSS files without
rewriting the relative URLs, leading to missing assets.

`BUGFIX: Publishable Node Context considers dimension fallbacks <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/512>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Context created for Nodes in a workspace in the ``PublishingService``
was derived from the ``NodeData`` entities dimension values, which should only
be the target values of the context but (wrongly) doesn't consider fallbacks
configured in presets.

To solve this a new method in the PresetSource allows to find best matching
presets based on target values for dimensions. Those are then used to
get a ``Context`` with fallback rules for dimensions, avoiding errors with
missing nodes in the root path as these might only exist within a ``Context``
that considers fallback rules.

The ``ContentDimensionPresetSourceInterface`` is not declared public ``@api``
so the change is not marked breaking.
