========
Neos 7.2
========

This release of Neos comes with some great new features, bugfixes and a lot of modernisation of the existing code base.

As usual, we worked hard to keep this release as backwards compatible as possible, but some of the changes might require manual
adjustments. So please make sure to carefully read the upgrade instructions below.


************
New Features
************

FEATURE: Allow NodeTypes to be defined in hierarchical folders
--------------------------------------------------------------

This feature allows ``NodeType.*.yaml`` files to be put into nested
folders underneath ``<Package-Root>/NodeTypes``::

 Packages
   Some.Package
     Configuration
       NodeTypes.yaml (still supported!)
     NodeTypes
       Foo
         Bar.yaml (new)

FEATURE: Fusion Memo object
---------------------------

This Fusion object stores its value based on
the given discriminator and returns the same
result in future calls during the same rendering.
The value will then not be evaluated again.

Example::

 prototype(My.Vendor:Expensive.Calculation) < prototype(Neos.Fusion:Memo) {
     discriminator = 'expensive-calculation'
     value = ${1+2}
 }
 myValue = My.Vendor:Expensive.Calculation
 myValue2 = My.Vendor:Expensive.Calculation

FEATURE: Upgrade font awesome to version 5.15
---------------------------------------------

With this PR we get news brand icons and covid-19 icons. Also some bugfixes related to unicode  issues and much more.

See the changes here https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/compare/5.12.1...5.15.3

Updated the font awesome resources and adjusted the paths to our needs.

Use a new Icon like head-side-mask.
