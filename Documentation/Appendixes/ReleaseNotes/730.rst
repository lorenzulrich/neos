========
Neos 7.3
========

This release of Neos comes with some great new features, bug fixes, and a lot of modernization.

As usual, we worked hard to keep this release as backward compatible as possible, but some of the changes might require manual
adjustments. So please make sure to read the upgrade instructions below carefully.


************
New Features
************


AFX shorthand for ``@if`` and ``@process``
------------------------------------------

Automatically generates keys for ``@if`` and ``@process`` when no one is specified.

.. code-block:: html

  <Vendor.Site:Prototype @if={eel1} image.@if={eel2} />

Fusion/AFX escaped attribute names (paths) with dots inside
-----------------------------------------------------------

Now it is possible to use dots in attributes and thus AlpineJS (for example) in AFX and Fusion.
If you escape the attribute/path, the Fusion parser will not disturb you and won't make a nested object path out of it, as before.

AFX
***

.. code-block:: html

 <div '@foo.bar'='baz'></div>

Generated Fusion
****************

::

 Neos.Fusion:Tag {
    attributes.'@foo.bar' = 'baz'
 }

HTML Output
***********

.. code-block:: html

 <div @foo.bar="baz"></div>

Introduce ThumbnailRefreshed signal to the Neos.Media package
-------------------------------------------------------------

Packages like ``MOC.ImageOptimizer`` that are necessary for achieving optimal performance currently have to use unstable APIs (aspects) to access freshly created image-crops. The existing signals ``ThumbnailPersisted`` and ``ThumbnailCreated`` do not cover this use case.

This change introduces the ``ThumbnailRefreshed`` signal to the ``Neos.Media`` package that package authors can use to optimize the rendered thumbnails further before they are presented to the user.

Filter by collections in ``media:removeunused``
-----------------------------------------------

The assets, the ``media:removeunused`` command takes into account can now be filtered by collections by specifying a comma-separated list of collection titles with the ``â€”only-collections``

Add Neos.CliSetup package
-------------------------

* ``./flow welcome`` Shows a welcome message with information on how to set up Neos via CLI.
* ``./flow setup:database`` Configure the database connection interactively
* ``./flow setup:imagehandler`` Configure the image handling interactively

Add support for AVIF format
---------------------------

You can now set ``avif`` as a format for generated images. Currently avif is only supported by ``imagick > 7.0.10-25`` and ``libheif > 1.7.0``.

Allow setting the position of backend modules
---------------------------------------------

For example, if you want to move the media module after the workspace module, you are now able to do this like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

 Neos:
   Neos:
     modules:
       management:
         submodules:
           media:
             position: 'after workspaces'

Add case-insensitive filter operators for FlowQuery
----------------------------------------------------

It is now possible to use case-insensitive filter operators for FlowQuery.

* ExactMatchInsensitive: ``=~``
* NotEqualMatchInsensitive: ``!=~``
* SuffixMatchInsensitive: ``$=~``
* PrefixMatchInsensitive: ``^=~``
* SubstringMatchInsensitive: ``*=~``

Show asset collections and tag for read-only asset sources
----------------------------------------------------------

Asset sources have a method ``isReadOnly()`` to tell whether they are read-only or not. A read-only asset source does not allow its content to be changed.

With this change, that read-only state is no longer coupled to the display of asset collections and tags in the media browser. Asset sources thus are free to implement a "connection" to asset collections and tags in any reasonable way.

********************
!!! Breaking changes
********************


Deprecate Fusion Namespaces
---------------------------

Add deprecation notice for the namespace to the parser and corresponding interface.

Starting with Neos version 8, this code will not work anymore:
**************************************************************

Alias a namespace

::

 namespace: Foo = Acme.Demo
 video = Foo:YouTube


You will need to declare the namespace fully (add ``Neos.Fusion:`` in front)

::

  content = DataStructure
  # or
  root = Page

Always show current node in breadcrumb
--------------------------------------

* ``Neos.Neos:BreadcrumbMenu`` was using ``node``, this is fixed and use ``documentNode`` now
* ``Neos.Neos:BreadcrumbMenuItems`` returned the nodes in the wrong order
* On both prototypes, the current node is now always rendered, even when it is hidden in index

Related issue: `#3407 <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/3407>`_


Set the default for new shortcut nodes to ``parent``
----------------------------------------------------

The default value for the ``target`` is now ``parent`` instead of ``firstChildNode``
