`BUGFIX: Do not cache non-existing accounts <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/2247>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When creating a new user and retrieving it within the same request from the user service will result in `null` even though, the user has been created successfully. This happens because of an error in the internal runtime cache. 

This regression was introduced in:
https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/commit/`dce483f9b0d17e3478777270eadebebbaca0d2dd <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/commit/dce483f9b0d17e3478777270eadebebbaca0d2dd>`_

Since this is broken in the most recent bugfix release, I would like to propose to merge this into 2.3. (which is otherwise only open for security fixes).
