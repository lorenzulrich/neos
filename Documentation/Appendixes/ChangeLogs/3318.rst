`BUGFIX: Removed super types can be added again regardless of order <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/2272>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I noticed the order of `superTypes` being of importance in one special case: re-adding a super type removed by a super type.
There already was a test, but it didn't catch one case: the re-addition being positioned **before** the super type where it was removed. Run the same test with only the changes in [NodeTypeTest.php](https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/2272/files#diff-960a57534a39e75dc45c37535d2ba971R108) and you'll get a [failed test](https://travis-ci.org/ComiR/neos-development-collection/jobs/454551553).

By making the Method `addInheritedSuperTypes()` `static` and slightly modifying it to not handing over the array, I could get rid of `buildInheritanceChain()` completely and renamed the method to `getFlattenedSuperTypes()`.
The `array_unique()` present before wasn't useful anyway because the array was already indexed by the node type names.

As a reminder: The visibility is determined by class and not by object. You can just call `$nodeType->declaredSuperTypes`, even if it is another object (of the same class of course)!

Since I started working on the `master` branch, there also is a version for that: https://github.com/ComiR/neos-development-collection/commit/`a8076ae958676e1309a4e33a51491d3204847239 <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/commit/a8076ae958676e1309a4e33a51491d3204847239>`_.
