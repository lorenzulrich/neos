`BUGFIX: Respect fallback rule "strictness" in FusionView <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/2976>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Neos finds a content dimension named "language" it uses that
dimension to set the locale fallback order for rendering in the
`FusionView`.

In Neos 5.0 that rule was switched to "strict" mode, meaning the order
was used without falling back to implicit parents in locales. This
broke translations in case the "language" dimension was configured with
e.g. `de_DE` or `en_US` - for those cases translations were never used if
the respective XLIFF files were in `de` (or `en`) folders.

This change makes the `FusionView` use the strict flag from the settings,
giving back control to the user (in case non-strict is really needed).
At the same time it makes translations work as would be expected in
most cases, by using e.g. `de_DE` first, but falling back to `de` later.

Fixes #2963

`BUGFIX: Revert ContentCollection constraint change <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/2978>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This reverts commit `b48660b28c1de596e74d4a95b8547d743b5199f1 <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/commit/b48660b28c1de596e74d4a95b8547d743b5199f1>`_ as it’s breaking the „constraint“ best practices for node types and allows to many NodeTypes in existing projects suddenly.

As the previous fix is still necessary I will create a new PR for a next Neos version 5.3 or 6.0 depending on the final solution.

Without the fix the actual constraint to only allow Content NodeTypes is done by the Neos.Ui and NOT by our NodeType definition which causes an inconsistency when working with the CR via its API or when analysing the NodeType definitions.
